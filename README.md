Used pandas to do some analysis on the dataframes. 

mainly the dataframe was about sales over a website. There were 12 csv files representing the sales over the year in each month. I merged the csv files to make it easier
for analysis. Then i performed some data cleaning and visualization. Afterwards, I tried to answer some specific questions. These are:

What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
